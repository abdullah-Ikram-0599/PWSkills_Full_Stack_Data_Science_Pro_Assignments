    "##### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of size, the smallest at the top, thus forming a conical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another    stack or on an empty rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of the recursion works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem is divided into two smaller problems of size n-1 in the first and third recursive          calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first recursive call moves n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then, the largest disk (disk n) is moved from the source to the destination rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, the third recursive call moves the n-1 disks that we left on the auxiliary rod to the        destination rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The base case is when the disk to be moved is the smallest one (i.e., n==1), it is simply moved        from the source to the destination rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, all disks end up on the destination rod in the correct order. The recursion ensures that the rules of the game are followed and that only smaller disks are placed on top of larger ones. The recursion ends when there are no more disks on the source rod. The auxiliary rod is used as a temporary rod to hold disks from the source rod while they are being moved."
